planet-ass-mac-screensaver
==========================

PlanetAss is a little screensaver that shows a jacked up "planet" that morphs and twinges for your amusement!

Originally, it was from a project based on http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000089.php ... then I 
made a script (https://brianin3d-misc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scripts/new_mac_screen_saver.sh)

I ran the script like: new_mac_screen_saver.sh PlanetAss <-- suddenly a world is born!

If you like xcode / bullshit, you can fool with it like this:

- to open in xcode: PlanetAss.xcodeproj/
- to build it: SHIFT+APPLE+b and click build
- to install it: open build/Debug/PlanetAss.saver

If you love the freedom and want liberty for all the earth's people, you can be a hero and run: runme.sh

The file where the actual code is is PlanetAssView.mm it is a real life train wreck!

What kinda of terrible hacker just slams all his code in one file because he is so damned lazy?

OK... at least you have a run me script, you can also just run

% xcodebuild && open ./build/Release/PlanetAss.saver

How great is that?! Keep you answer to yourself! No! I'm kidding, tell me how you love it!
